# Naive Implementations

The following is for building the naive implementations of Matrix multiplication and Image Convolutions

| Optimized for | Description                          |
|:------------- |:------------------------------------ |
| OS            | Tested on Pop_OS! 21.04              |
| Software      | Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler |

### Purpose

The purpose for these implementations is to test and benchmark against the parallel implementations of the DPC++ implementations

# Building the Files

* Build the programs using Make   
  make 

* Clean the program  
  make clean 

## Running the Files

You can run either the Image conv or matrix multiplication.

- Run inside the terminal 
  - ./NaiveImageConv
  - ./MatrixMult
